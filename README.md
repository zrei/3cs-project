This is an exploratory project where I learn more about Unreal 5 and C++ by working on various features related to the 3Cs (Character, Camera, Control) and animation in Unreal. This project was completed under the guidance of a mentor from Ubisoft Singapore.

## Implemented Features
* Basic character and third-person camera controller
* Character animation (locomotion state machine, look overlay)
* Feet IK
* Walk and run gaits
* Turn in place to face camera view direction and turn during walk/run state
* Rope swinging

## Explored Aspects of Unreal
* Utilised data assets for collections of parameters (e.g. feet IK settings)
* Utilised animation instances to calculate values of variables that drive animation
